      <p id="aboutMeContent"> &emsp; As a high school student in Southern California, I have consistently demonstrated my academic strengths, ranking in the top 2 percentile of my grade. I am always ready to help my peers, whether they need academic assistance, emotional support, or simply a listening ear.

      Music has been a significant part of my life. I have been a member of my school’s honors choir and have pursued professional piano training since I was five. My artistic talents extend to the stage, where I have participated in multiple drama productions, and to writing, where I have finished and am currently publishing a sci-fi novel.

      My passion for environmental protection led me to found Global Climate Crisis, a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing environmental issues. This initiative reflects my commitment to making a positive impact on the world.

        <p id="aboutMeContent"> &emsp; Looking ahead, I aspire to become a dermatologist. My ability to empathaize for those with skin conditions drives this ambition, as I first-handedly understand the profound impact such conditions can have on a person's life. I also envision traveling internationally to educate people in developing countries about medical issues related to nutritional deficiencies, such as dry skin resulting from lack of vitamins A, D, E, and zinc and iron. Additionally, I aim to raise awareness about the effects of unclean water on the skin, including chronic eczema and urticaria, which can be debilitating. Through these efforts, I hope to make a meaningful difference in the health and well-being of people around the world.

          The music I listen to has inspired me to start writing and making music. I am currently in the process of creating an album. I am a pianist with advanced training in piano. I have been playing it for the past ten years and have been awarded with branch and state honors for multiple years. In the songs I am creating, my main instrument is piano, and I create a soothing tone through it.

          &emsp;As the founder of Global Climate Crisis, I am dedicated to tackling climate change through environmental protection and sustainability. My activism stems from a deep concern for the planet and a desire to make a real impact.
            </p>

            <p class="generalP">
           One of our key initiatives is organizing beach cleanups, where volunteers unite to remove large amounts of trash, fostering a strong sense of community. We also engage with nursing homes and schools, delivering talks to raise awareness about climate change and encourage action.
              </p>
          <p class="generalP">
           In elementary schools, we conduct campus cleanups to teach young students the importance of environmental stewardship. We focus on practical steps to reduce carbon footprints, such as promoting vegetarian diets and advocating for electric vehicles and reduced air travel. Through workshops and resources, we empower individuals to make more sustainable choices in their daily lives.
